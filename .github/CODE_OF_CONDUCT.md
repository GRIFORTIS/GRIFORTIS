## Code of Conduct for GRIFORTIS Projects

GRIFORTIS maintains a collection of open-source projects focused on long-term digital inheritance, backup robustness, and self-sovereign security.  
Because these projects often touch real financial assets and highly sensitive data, we expect all contributors and community members to uphold a high standard of professionalism and respect.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant and applies to all repositories under the `GRIFORTIS` organization, as well as any official community spaces (issue trackers, discussions, pull requests, and documentation).

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to:

- Make participation in our projects and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- Act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, safe, and constructive community.

---

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for users and the broader community.
- Showing empathy and care for other community members, especially non-experts and heirs who may rely on these tools.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information (such as physical or email address) without their explicit permission.
- Any behavior that would be reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. They may:

- Edit, remove, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers are expected to communicate moderation decisions clearly and, where appropriate, offer guidance on how behavior can be improved.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:

- Within all project spaces (repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and documentation), and
- In public spaces when an individual is representing a project or the GRIFORTIS organization.

Examples of representing a project or organization include:

- Using an official project or organization account online,
- Presenting at a conference on behalf of GRIFORTIS or one of its projects,
- Participating in events or workshops branded with GRIFORTIS or one of its tools.

## Enforcement

If you observe or experience unacceptable behavior, you are encouraged to report it. Until a dedicated contact channel is published, please:

- Refer to the relevant repository’s `SECURITY.md` and `README.md` for current contact information, and/or  
- Open a high-level issue asking for a private moderation contact if you are not comfortable sharing details publicly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated as appropriate to the circumstances. The maintainers will strive to respect the privacy and security of reporters.

Enforcement actions may include:

- A private warning.
- A temporary or permanent ban from project spaces.
- Escalation to organization owners or, in severe cases, relevant third parties.
